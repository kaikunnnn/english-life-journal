**Education and University Experience**

I grew up in Miyazaki prefecture, which is quite a rural area in Japan. During high school, I had to wake up really early - I'd leave for school at 7:30 AM and wouldn't get back until at least 4:30 PM. It was one of those typical Japanese high schools where the main focus was preparing students for university entrance exams. I wasn't really into joining any official school clubs, but I did get involved in a band with some friends. Since we were in a small town, the school didn't have a proper music club, so we were basically what we call "帰宅部" in Japanese - meaning we didn't belong to any school clubs. We'd perform at local venues about once every three months, and I had to help sell tickets for our shows, which was actually pretty tough. But those band practices and live performances were some of my fondest memories from high school.

When it came to choosing my university and major, I didn't have any particular passion for Management - I just wanted to get out of my hometown and experience life in a big city. So after taking the entrance exams and seeing my scores, I ended up choosing Tokyo Metropolitan University. That decision completely transformed my life. Moving from Miyazaki to Tokyo was like night and day - the biggest difference was definitely the people I met. Tokyo is full of ambitious, driven people, especially in the business world, who are constantly pushing boundaries and taking on new challenges. Even as a student, I found myself surrounded by people who were organizing fashion shows, running volunteer organizations, or diving into the latest internet trends. Being exposed to all these different perspectives really opened my eyes and changed how I thought about my future. Through these connections, I discovered my interest in web design and digital technology, which eventually led me to pursue a career as a digital designer. Looking back, that exposure to diverse, motivated people was probably the most valuable thing I gained from choosing to study in Tokyo.

#### ポイント:「since + 理由（主語＋動詞）」の形で文頭や文中に使うことができます。

文頭に置くと、理由を強調できます。
「because」と似ていますが、「since」は理由が明らかなときや、説明を補足する感じで使われることが多いです。

## The reason why I chose Management as my major at university.

~~I have no reason to choice the major of Mnagement. ~~
~~The reason I choose my uni and my major was because of the plan I want to go city from my local area.~~

> I didn't have a specific reason for choosing Management as my major.

解説：

##### 時制の修正

- "choose" → "chose" (過去形)
  - 大学での経験は過去の話なので、過去形を使用します

##### 冠詞の追加

- "university" の前に "my" を追加
  - 特定の大学を指す場合は冠詞が必要です

##### 文の構造の改善

- "I have no reason to choice" → "I didn't have a specific reason for choosing"
  - より自然な英語表現に修正

「I have no reason to choose 〜」は「〜を選ぶ理由がない（だから選ばない）」という意味。
「I didn't have a specific reason for choosing 〜」は「（選んだけど）特に理由はなかった」という意味。
「特に理由がなかった」と言いたい場合は、「I didn't have a specific reason for choosing 〜」が自然で正しい表現です。

##### スペルミスの修正

- "Managiment" → "Management"
- "Mnagement" → "Management"

##### 前置詞の修正

- "major at my university" → "as my major at university"
  - より自然な表現に修正

##### 略語の使用

- "uni" は口語的な表現なので、正式な文章では "university" を使用

例えば大学時代にファッションショーをやっている人たちだったりとか、ボランティアをやる団体をやってる人だったりとか 出会いました。
また IT を使っている人たち、特に SNS が盛り上がったときそういう人たちとも出会うことができて、
その影響で僕もインターネットに興味を持つきっかけになり、ウェブデザインと言うものに出会うことができました。

まぁおそらく宮崎でも出会えたかもしれませんけど、出会える確率は低かったかなぁと思います。
今ではそのデジタル領域のデザインが僕の仕事になっているので、
そういう意味では あまりよくわからない時期にいろんな刺激を受けると言うのは一定大事なのかなというの見られたのが
まぁ東京に来て 1 番のメリットだったかなと思います。
